            Hangman originated in England during the 17th century and was played when a prisoner facing death demanded
            the “Rite of Words and Rites”. The actual origin of the game is unknown.

                How to Play Hangman: 8 Simple Rules
                The object of hangman is to guess the secret word before the stick figure is hung. Players take turns
                selecting letters to narrow the word down. Players can take turns or work together. Gameplay continues
                until the players guess the word or they run out of guesses and the stick figure is hung.</p>
