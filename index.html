            Did you know: Hangman originated in England during the 17th century and
            was played when a prisoner facing death demanded the “Rite of Words and
            Rites”. The actual origin of the game is unknown.

            <li>Players take turns selecting letters to narrow the word down.</li>
            <li>Players can take turns or work together.</li>
