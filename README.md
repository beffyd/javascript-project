# Design 

## Colour Scheme 

![colour-palete](/assets/imgs/colour-pallete-hangman.png)

## Typography

I have use used the font 'Rubik' as it is sans-serif font, which are known for their readability. To allow the user to easily read and digest the hangman facts.

I have also used the font 'Bungee Spice' which is also a sans serif font, I also picked this font as it was the first font I have seen on google fonts with a gradient and design built in, and it also fit my game theme very well as it looks like an arcade machine font.

## Imagery

The image I have used for the hangman was from shutterstock.

## General Features

The website is comprised of a home page and a game page.

## **The home page**

The home page is just a short introduction to the hangman game for those who are not familiar with it, with a couple of facts about the games origin for those who are interested.

## **Game Page**
The game page consists of an image (that changes when you guess incorrect), a box to put ur guess in and a button to submit the guess to check if the letter is in the secret word.

# Accessibility

I have been mindful whilst coding to ensure the website is accessible. This has been achieved by:
*  Using semantic HTML

* Using bright colurs that compliment eachother to allow the text to be read easily.
